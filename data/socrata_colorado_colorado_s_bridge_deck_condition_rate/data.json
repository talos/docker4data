  "description": "Bridges in good condition typically have a rating from 80 to 100 and generally meet all safety and geometry standards. Good structures typically only require preservation-focused maintenance. Bridges in fair condition have a sufficiency rating from 50 to 80 and are qualified as structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. They marginally satisfy safety and geometry standards and require preservation-focused maintenance or occasional corrective rehabilitation work. Any bridge with a sufficiency rating of less than 50 and a status of structurally deficient or functionally obsolete is considered to be in poor condition. Bridges rated poor have exceeded their viable service life and require replacement or major rehabilitation.",
