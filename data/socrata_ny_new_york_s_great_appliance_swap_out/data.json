  "description": "As part of the American Recovery and Revetment Act, NYSERDA administered an $18.7 million residential high-efficiency appliance rebate program called New York's Great Appliance Swap Out. Under the approved U.S. Department of Energy plan, customers purchasing appliances qualified for a rebate of $75 ($105 with documented recycling) for ENERGY STAR qualified refrigerators, $75 ($100 with documented recycling) for clothes washers and $50 ($75 with documented recycling) for freezers. $500 rebate ($555 with documented recycling) were also available for high-efficiency dishwashers, clothes washers and refrigerators that meet CEE super efficiency levels when they were purchased as part of a three-appliance package. The plan was approved by the DOE on December 1, 2009. The program was launched February 12, 2010 and closed March 4, 2011 after processing over $16.58 million in rebates",
