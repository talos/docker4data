  "description": "The Baltimore RPP Program was begun in 1979 in an effort to address the specific needs of residents in city neighborhoods where the demand for on-street parking was considered to be greatest. Participating neighborhoods elect to do so through application by petition to the City of Baltimore through the Parking Authority of Baltimore City.\n\nSince its inception, the RPP Program has grown to include 41 designated RPP areas, each designated with its own specific number or letter. Parking in each of these 41 areas is restricted to some degree to provide preferential parking privileges only to those residents and their guests who display valid Residential Parking Permits and Visitors Passes on their automobiles. These permits and passes are issued and valid for a one-year period from the designated annual renewal date for each specific RPP Area. Residents must re-apply every year.",
