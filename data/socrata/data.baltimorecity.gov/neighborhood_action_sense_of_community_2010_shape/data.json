These include: the number of neighborhood associations and block groups; the number of Community Development Corporations (CDCs); the number of umbrella organizations; the number of park stewardship groups; the number of community gardens; Healthy Neighborhood Initiative locations; the number of historic properties; the percentage of the population registered to vote; and the percentage of persons voting.",
