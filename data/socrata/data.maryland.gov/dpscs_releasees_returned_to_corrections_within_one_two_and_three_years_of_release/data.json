  "description": "The key metric of recidivism for Maryland and for the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS) is the cumulative percentage of releasees who return to Corrections within three years. Since the start of the O'Malley-Brown administration we have driven down recidivism rates at a record pace. This dataset shows how many releasees return to Corrections within one, two, and three years of release. DPSCS's Office of Grants Policy and Statistics (GPS) publishes these data annually in their Repeat Incarceration Supervision Cycle (RISC) reports. The newest data were published in August 2013. Data for FY 2012 are scheduled to be released in summer 2014.",
