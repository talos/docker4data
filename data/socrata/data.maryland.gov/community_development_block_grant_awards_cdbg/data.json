  "description": "Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds help strengthen Maryland\u2019s communities by expanding affordable housing opportunities, creating jobs, stabilizing neighborhoods, and improving overall quality of life. Congress created the Community Development Block Grant Program under Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. The primary objective is to develop viable communities, provide decent housing and a suitable living environment, and to expand economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) oversees the Program. The CDBG Program is comprised of two parts. The Entitlement Program is directly administered by HUD and provides Federal funds to large metropolitan \"entitlement\" communities. The States and Small Cities Program provides Federal funds to the States and Puerto Rico (with the exception of Hawaii) who then distribute funds to \"non-entitlement\" counties, small cities and towns. Congress allocates funds to the program annually. The Entitlement Program receives approximately 70% of the allocation and the remaining 30% is distributed to the States and Small Cities Program. Maryland's CDBG Program is administered by the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), in cooperation with the Maryland Department of Business and Economic Development (DBED). Funding Levels The State of Maryland receives its share of the 30% allocated to States and Small Cities based on poverty and population statistics. Maryland's Program is divided into two major funding categories: Community Development and Economic Development. Community Development receives approximately 72% of the allocation and Economic Development receives 25%. The remaining funds are spent for State administration of the Program (2% + $100,000) and technical assistance to grantees (1%). USES OF FUNDS CDBG funded projects must meet one of three national objectives: Principally benefits persons of low- and moderate- income Eliminates slum and blight Meets an urgent need of recent origin threatens public health and safety Eligible projects generally fall into three types: Housing Public facilities (water/sewer; streets; childcare, senior or community centers; shelters) Economic development projects Over a designated three-year period, the State must cumulatively use 70% of its allocation to benefit persons of low and moderate income CDBG funded programs must meet one of three national objectives: (1) Principally benefits persons of low- and moderate- income, (2) Eliminates slum and blight, and (3) Meets an urgent need of recent origin threatens public health and safety. Eligible projects generally fall into three types: (1) Housing, (2) Public facilities (water/sewer; streets; childcare, senior or community centers; shelters), and (3) Economic development projects. http://www.neighborhoodrevitalization.org/Programs/CDBG/CDBG.aspx",
