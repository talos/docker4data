  "description": "This data summarizes the 2013 adopted budget for the City of Albany.  Over the years, we've consolidated or eliminated departments, cut personnel, refinanced debt, reduced departmental expenditures, extended the life of our landfill, successfully lobbied for increase State aid and identified new sources of revenue.  These actions are the blocks upon which this budget is built, as they continue to have a recurring benefit to our bottom line.  It is important to note that, in fact, 84% of this budget, exclusive of debt services, is related to personnel costs.  The remainder is related to essential operating services, such as utility expenses; building maintenance; insurance costs and the like.",
