CSLAP is a volunteer lake monitoring and education program that is managed by DEC and New York State Federation of Lake Associations (NYSFOLA). The data collected through the program is used to identify water quality issues, detect seasonal and long term patterns, and inform volunteers and lake residents about water quality conditions in their lake. The program has delivered high quality data to many DEC programs for over 25 years.\r\nThe dataset catalogs CSLAP lake information; including: lake name, lake depth, public accessibility, trophic status, watershed area, elevation, lake area, water quality classification, county, town, CSLAP status, years sampled, and last year sampled.",
