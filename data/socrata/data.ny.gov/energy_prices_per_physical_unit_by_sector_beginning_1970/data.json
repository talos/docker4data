Energy prices are provided by fuel type in nominal dollars per specified physical unit for the residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors. This section includes a column in the price table displaying gross domestic product (GDP) price deflators for converting nominal (current year) dollars to constant (real) dollars. To convert nominal to constant dollars, divide the nominal energy price by the GDP price deflator for that particular year. Historical petroleum, electricity, coal, and natural gas prices were compiled primarily from the Energy Information Administration.",
