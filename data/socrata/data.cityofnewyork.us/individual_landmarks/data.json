  "description": "This dataset contains information on all items designated or under consideration for designation (i.e. calendared) by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC), including items that may have been denied designation or overturned. The dataset contains records for each individual, scenic, or interior landmark, as well as properties or sites located within the boundaries of historic districts. Please note that points in this dataset represent individual buildings in addition to non-building sites (such as vacant lots or monuments) regulated by LPC. It is possible for a single property to have multiple designations (such as individual and interior designations, or individual and historic district). For this reason, it is not uncommon to see multiple points on a single tax lot and multiple records for a single property within the database. Please pay close attention to the \"MOST_CURRENT,\" \"BBL_STATUS and \"LAST_ACTION_ON_LP\" fields, which together denote the designation status of a site/property (see Attribute Definitions for more information). The geographic locations of the points in this dataset are derived primarily from the Department of City Planning's PLUTO data in combination with the Department of Information Technology & Telecommunication's building footprint information. Because this dataset is not automatically updated when changes occur in the underlying dataset, BIN numbers and tax lot information are potentially out of date. Please pay close attention to the field descriptions present in the file's metadata to understand how to use this data set.",
