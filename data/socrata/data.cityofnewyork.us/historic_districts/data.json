  "description": "This dataset contains boundaries and associated attribute information for all designated historic districts or areas under consideration for historic district designation (i.e. calendared) by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC), including items that may have been denied designation or overturned. Please note that some areas may have multiple records in the database if different actions were taken over time. Please pay close attention to the \"CURRENT\" and \"LAST_ACTION_ON_BOUNDARY\" fields to determine the status of a particular area. The geographic locations of the polygons in this dataset are derived primarily from the Department of City Planning's PLUTO dataset, and therefore discrepancies may arise where the LPC dataset has not been updated with information from the most recent PLUTO releases. Please pay close attention to the field descriptions present in the file's metadata to understand how to use this dataset. And please contact LPC if there are questions or concerns",
