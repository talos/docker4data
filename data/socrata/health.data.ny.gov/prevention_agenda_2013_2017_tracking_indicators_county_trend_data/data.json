  "description": "This is one of three datasets related to the Prevention Agenda Tracking Indicators county level data posted on this site. Each dataset consists of county level data for 68 health tracking indicators and sub-indicators for the Prevention Agenda 2013-2017: New York State\u2019s Health Improvement Plan.  A health tracking indicator is a metric through which progress on a certain area of health improvement can be assessed.  The indicators are organized by the Priority Area of the Prevention Agenda as well as the Focus Area under each Priority Area.  Each dataset includes tracking indicators for the five Priority Areas of the Prevention Agenda 2013-2017.  The most recent year dataset includes the most recent county level data for all indicators. The trend dataset includes the most recent county level data and historical data, where available. Each dataset also includes the Prevention Agenda 2017 state targets for the indicators. Sub-indicators are included in these datasets to measure health disparities among socioeconomic groups.
