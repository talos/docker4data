The data also includes the names, locations, and contact information for the agencies who oversee WIC vendors in NYS (WIC Vendor Management Agencies). The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) offers nutrition education, breastfeeding support, referrals and a variety of nutritious foods to low-income pregnant, breastfeeding or postpartum women, infants and children up to age five to promote and support good health. WIC improves the health of pregnant women, new mothers and their infants and children. The foods provided through WIC are a good source of nutrients often missing from the diets of women and young children. WIC participants have longer, healthier pregnancies and fewer premature births. For more information, check out: http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/nutrition/wic/ or go to the \u201cAbout\u201d tab.",
