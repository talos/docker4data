These are conditions where 1) the need for hospitalization is potentially preventable with appropriate outpatient care, or 2) conditions that could be less severe if treated early and appropriately. All PQIs apply only to adult populations (over the age of 18 years).   \r\n\r\nThe rates were calculated using Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) inpatient data and Claritas population information.  \r\n\r\nThe observed rates and expected rates for each AHRQ PQI is presented by either resident county (including a statewide total) or resident zip code (including a statewide total).
