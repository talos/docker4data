  "description": "The Student Weight Status Category Reporting System (SWSCR) collects weight status category data (underweight, healthy weight, overweight or obese, based on BMI-for-age percentile) at school entry (pre-kindergarten or kindergarten) and in grades 2, 4, 7 and 10 for students attending all public schools outside of the five boroughs of New York City.\r\n\r\nBecause of restrictions in reporting due to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) there was wide variation in how much of the student population was represented in the data schools submitted during 2008-2010. Therefore the percentage of the student population represented in the county-level estimates varies from county to county.  This limits researchers' ability to draw absolute conclusions about observed differences in student weight status among counties.\r\n\r\nFor more information check out http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/obesity/.",
