  "description": "Infection caused by the Neisseria Meningitidis bacteria results in acute illness that may include symptoms such as sudden onset of fever, headache, nausea, stiff neck, photophobia, and, in most cases, a rash. Invasive disease may manifest itself as one or more syndromes including bacteremia, sepsis, and meningitis. Meningitis is the most common form, while sepsis, also known as Meningococcemia, is the most severe form of illness. While advances in medicine have improved survivability, some cases may still result in long-term aftereffects or death.",
