Millions of years of streams cutting down through this region have resulted in gypsum capped bluffs, gorges, and canyons exposing soft red shale and sandstones.  Caves and extensive cave systems created by the dissolution of gypsum provide critical habitat for many species of hibernating and breeding bats.",
