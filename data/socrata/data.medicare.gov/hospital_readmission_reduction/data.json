Excess readmissions are measured by a ratio, by dividing a hospital\u2019s number of \u201cpredicted\u201d 30-day readmissions for heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia by the number that would be \u201cexpected,\u201d based on an average hospital with similar patients. A ratio greater than 1 indicates excess readmissions.",
