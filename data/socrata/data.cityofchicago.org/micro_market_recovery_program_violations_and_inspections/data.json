The goal of MMRP is to improve conditions, strengthen property values, and create environments supportive of private investment in targeted areas by strategically deploying public and private capital and other tools and resources in well-defined micro-markets.  This MMRP Violations and Inspections dataset contains Department of Buildings (DOB) Violations and associated Inspections that have occured at properties falling within an MMRP Zone.  Permits, Cases and Violations can be linked to the MMRP Geographies dataset using ADDRKEY or ADDRGRPKEY.  To link Violations and Inspections to their Permits and Cases use Violation PERMITORCASEKEY and link to Permits APKEY_PERMIT and Cases APKEY_CASE.  *Note: Inspections are included only when at least one violation was written.  Inspections without violations are not included in this dataset.",
