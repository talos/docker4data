  "description": "This dataset serves as a lookup table to determine if environmental records exist in a Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) environmental dataset for a given address.   \r\nData fields requiring description are detailed below. \r\nMAPPED LOCATION: Contains the address, city, state and latitude/longitude coordinates of the facility. In instances where the facility address is a range, the lower number (the value in the \u201cStreet Number From\u201d column) is used. For example, for the range address 1000-1005 S Wabash Ave, the Mapped Location would be 1000 S Wabash Ave. The latitude/longitude coordinate is determined through the Chicago Open Data Portal\u2019s geocoding process.  Addresses that fail to geocode are assigned the coordinates 41.88415000022252\u00b0, -87.63241000012124\u00b0.This coordinate is located approximately just south of the intersection of W Randolph and N LaSalle.\r\nCOMPLAINTS:  A \u2018Y\u2019 indicates that one or more records exist in the CDPH Environmental Complaints dataset. \r\nNESHAPS & DEMOLITON NOTICES:  A \u2018Y\u2019 indicates that one or more records exist in the CDPH Asbestos and Demolition Notification dataset. \r\nENFORCEMENT:  A \u2018Y\u2019 indicates that one or more records exist in the CDPH Environmental Enforcement dataset. \r\nINSPECTIONS:  A \u2018Y\u2019 indicates that one or more records exist in the CDPH Environmental Inspections dataset. \r\nPERMITS:  A \u2018Y\u2019 indicates that one or more records exist in the CDPH Environmental Permits dataset. \r\nTANKS:  A \u2018Y\u2019 indicates that one or more records exist in the CDPH Storage Tanks dataset.  Each 'Y' is a clickable link that will download the corresponding records in CSV format.",
