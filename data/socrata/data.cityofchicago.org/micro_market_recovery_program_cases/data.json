The goal of MMRP is to improve conditions, strengthen property values, and create environments supportive of private investment in targeted areas by strategically deploying public and private capital and other tools and resources in well-defined micro-markets. This MMRP Case dataset contains all Department of Buildings (DOB) Cases that have occured at properties falling within any MMRP Zone.  Permits, Cases and Violations can be linked to the MMRP Geographies dataset using ADDRKEY or ADDRGRPKEY.  To link Violations and Inspections to their Permits and Cases use Violation PERMITORCASEKEY to link to Permits APKEY_PERMIT and Cases APKEY_CASE.
