  "description": "This dataset contains environmental holds placed by the Department of Environment (DOE) up to December 31, 2011 and by the Department of Public Health (CDPH) post December 31, 2011 on construction-related permits issued by the City of Chicago. On January 1, 2012, the DOE was disbanded and all its inspection, permitting, and enforcement authorities were transferred to the CDPH. \r\nThis dataset also contains No Further Remediation Letters (NFRs) received by the DOE or the CDPH for properties that have been cleaned up under the Illinois Environmental Protections Agency\u2019s (IEPA) Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) program.\r\nData fields requiring description are detailed below. \r\nAPPLICATION ID:  Unique identifier of record.\r\nMAPPED LOCATION: Contains latitude/longitude coordinates of the site as determined through the Chicago Open Data Portal\u2019s geocoding engine. In instances where the facility address is a range, the lower number (the value in the \u201cStreet Number From\u201d column) is used for geocoding. For example, for the range address 1000-1005 S Wabash Ave, the Mapped Location would be the coordinates for 1000 S Wabash Ave. \r\nTYPE: Specifies the type of permit hold placed on a property or the hold released on an individual permit.  HIGHWAY AUTHORITY AGREEMENT is a permit hold placed on construction projects in the public right-of-way at certain locations in the City of Chicago. Refer to http://tinyurl.com/bn3grwt for more information. A THORIUM PERMIT HOLD is a permit hold placed on select properties in the Streeterville area for thorium contamination. Refer to http://tinyurl.com/d6wth39 . A THORIUM PERMIT HOLD RELEASE indicates that an applicant has complied with the necessary requirements and the Thorium Permit Hold has been lifted on the permit application. An NFR LUST is not a permit hold but the property may have certain land use restrictions or requirements (i.e. institutional or engineering controls) to prevent or minimize exposure of contaminants that may still be present at the property.\r\nDATE: Date the record was entered into the database. \r\nCOMMENT: Comments relating to the hold or release. \r\nDATA SOURCE: The city department that placed or released the hold.",
