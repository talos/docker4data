  "description": "These flow routes are derived from the 2008 DEM surface using ESRI Spatial Analyst stream order tool with STRAHLER ordering. The GRID_CODE field represents stream order. Lines with no tributaries are assigned an order of one and are referred to as first order. When two first-order links intersect, the downslope link is assigned an order of two. When two second-order links intersect, the downslope link is assigned an order of three and so on. This was undertaken as part of the urbanforest program, the shapefile excludes a portion of Kensington that became part of City of Melbourne after this data was processed.",
