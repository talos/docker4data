The agency must forward a copy of the report to the Ethics Commission within 30 days of its receipt.\r\n\r\nAfter the $5,000 threshold is met for a particular calendar year, all subsequent payments made by the same source during the calendar year must be reported by the elected officer within 30 days after the date the payment is made.\r\n\r\nThese reports are public records.  \r\n\r\nThe table includes all FPPC 803 forms filed with the Ethics Commission from April 20, 2015 to the present.",
