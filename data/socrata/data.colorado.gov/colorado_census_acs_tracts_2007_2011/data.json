  "description": "The American Community Survey (ACS) is an ongoing survey that provides data every year. The ACS measures the changing social and economic characteristics of the U.S. population. Basic categories of information from the survey include age, sex, race, family and relationships, income and benefits, health insurance, education, veteran status, disabilities, occupancy basics, travel to work, and costs for some essentials (data related to cost of living). Unlike the every-10-year census, the ACS survey continues all year, every year by randomly sampling addresses in every state, thus creating a \u201crolling average\u201d of data about designated geographic regions to generate up-to-date statistics. Because ACS data are collected continuously, they are not always comparable to data collected from the decennial census. Use caution when preparing \u201cchange-detection\u201d analyses using geographic boundaries as they are often changed between decades. There are two sets of data: one set with expected real values, and another (with M in front of the column name) with the actual measured values.",
