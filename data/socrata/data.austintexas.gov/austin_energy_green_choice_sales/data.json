  "description": "Austin Energy\u2019s GreenChoice program is the nation\u2019s most successful utility-sponsored, voluntary green-pricing energy program.  Customers who subscribe to GreenChoice pay a renewable energy charge in place of the utility's current fuel charge. Austin Energy led all 850 utility-sponsored programs in the country in 2010 for the most sales of renewable energy for the ninth year in a row. Beginning Oct. 1, 2011, the City of Austin switched to 100% clean, renewable energy -- becoming the largest local government in America to power all of its facilities with 100% green energy.",
