Some examples include awnings, overhead signs, outdoor seating, sidewalk displays, barber poles, permanent dumpsters, etc. A number of minor privileges can be more of a permanent nature that may have a long term impact and may not easily be removed such as cornices, steps, bay windows, storefronts and vaults.",
