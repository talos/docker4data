Rates are subject to operating schedules, available here: https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Meter-Operating-Schedules/6cqg-dxku. When the time limit of a meter is 0 minutes, such as during Tow or Alternate Schedule - Passenger Loading, parking is not available and therefore meter rates do not apply.
