The Department works in partnership with these agencies: 12 not-for-profit corporations and one unit of local government, the City of Chicago.\r\n\r\nArea Agencies have the primary task of planning and coordinating services and programs for older people in their respective areas. The Area Agencies receive funding from the Department based on a formula which takes into consideration the number of older citizens and minorities in that area, as well as the number living in poverty, in rural areas, and alone. \r\n\r\nLike the Department on Aging, Area Agencies are not, as a rule, direct service providers. Area Agencies contract with local agencies which provide services to the older people who live in the same community.",
